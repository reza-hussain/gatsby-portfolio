        After the lockdown hit, I started to use my free time to code. React was
        something that caught my interest and I decided to give it a try.
        Fast-forward to today, I have over 2 years of experience building
        products for tech companies. I am well-versed in MERN, Next.js and I'm
        starting to get better at Typescript. <br />
        <br /> I enjoy UI development especially the animations. Writing complex
        logic to achieve certain interactions is what my brain loves to do.{" "}

        When I'm not on my computer, I am mostly travelling, playing badminton
        or hanging out with my cousins. I am a cat person üêæ
